### Mitacs is a nonprofit national research organization that partners with Canadian universities, industry and government, to support research and training programs in the broad fields of industrial and social innovation.

Most Mitacs programs require a supervisor that is eligible to hold Tri-Agency funds and also typically require a 50% (+GST) cash contribution from an eligible partner. The intern must be an active student or postdoctoral fellow at the University, but the sponsor may consider recent graduates for internships. Most applications require the knowledge/approval of a Mitacs adviser (see below).
